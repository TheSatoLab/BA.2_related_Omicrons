# BA.2-related Omicron variants bearing Spike L452 mutations

After the global spread of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.2 lineage, some BA.2-related variants that acquire mutations in the L452 residue of spike protein, such as BA.2.9.1 and BA.2.13 (L452M), BA.2.12.1 (L452Q), and BA.2.11, BA.4 and BA.5 (L452R), emerged in multiple countries (Kimura et al., 2022, bioRxiv). This repository contains scripts for phylogenetic analysis and epidemic dynamics analysis as well as fastq files for the viral genome sequence to check working virus stocks.

## Contents:
*  **epidemic_dynamics_analysis:** a directory containing computational codes to estimate the relative effective reproduction number of each viral lineage
*  **phylogenetic_analysis:** a directory containing computational codes for phylogenetic analysis as well as reconstructed trees
*  **fastq files:** a directory containing fastq files for the viral genome sequence to check working virus stocks
